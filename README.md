## Case Background

### State v. Lynch

**Case Number**: 2022-MM-000538-A-O  
**Court**: Orange County Circuit Court, Florida  
**Judge**: Diego Madrigal III

A criminal case involving Kelli Lynch, who was charged with trafficking in hydrocodone (Count 2) - a first-degree felony. The case is notable for:

- **Suppressed Exculpatory Evidence**: Defense attorney Jonathan Mills failed to present prescription evidence that would have negated the trafficking charge
- **Witness Abandonment**: Critical witness Tara Weeks was arranged to testify at a June 20, 2022 bond hearing but was never called, resulting in a $5,000 bond increase
- **Attorney Misconduct**: Mills engaged in fraudulent billing, failed to provide promised work product, and made ex parte communications with the court
- **Judicial Misconduct**: Judge Madrigal conducted independent investigations, engaged in ex parte communications, and demonstrated clear bias

**Key Evidence Timeline**:
- **January 2022**: Lynch charged with first-degree felony trafficking
- **June 6, 2022**: Rusty Miller provides prescription evidence to attorney Mills via documented text message
- **June 20, 2022**: Mills fails to call witness despite her attendance; bond increased $5,000
- **October 4, 2023**: Sentencing hearing reveals Mills and judge had prior knowledge of prescription evidence
- **November 16, 2023**: Judge Madrigal targets non-party Miller, accesses sealed records, compels Lynch to oath restricting communication with Miller
- **February 23, 2024**: Judge admits conducting independent investigation: "I confirmed with the hospital myself!"

### Miller v. Madrigal

**Case**: Federal Civil Rights Lawsuit  
**Court**: United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division  
**Plaintiff**: Rusty Miller (private citizen, non-party to State v. Lynch)  
**Primary Defendants**: Judge Diego Madrigal III, Richard Walsh (State Attorney), Jonathan Mills (Defense Attorney), and others

Following the events in State v. Lynch, Judge Madrigal attacked private citizen Rusty Miller—who was never a party to the criminal case—leading to civil litigation: **Miller v. Madrigal et al.**

#### Why This Case Matters

This federal lawsuit challenges judicial immunity when judges:
- Act outside their jurisdictional authority
- Target non-parties to court proceedings
- Violate clearly established constitutional rights
- Conduct unauthorized searches and disclose sealed records
- Engage in defamation and retaliation

#### Constitutional Violations Alleged

**First Amendment**:
- Compelled speech restriction (oath prohibiting Lynch from communicating with Miller about legal matters)
- Retaliation for protected speech (exposing judicial and attorney misconduct)
- Freedom of association violations

**Fourth Amendment**:
- Unauthorized database searches on Miller
- Accessing sealed court records without jurisdiction
- Public disclosure of private information
- Violations of Stored Communications Act (18 U.S.C. § 2701)
- Violations of Driver's Privacy Protection Act (18 U.S.C. § 2721)

**Fourteenth Amendment**:
- Due process violations (sanctions without notice or hearing)
- Equal protection violations (selective targeting)
- Defamation in open court without opportunity to respond

#### Why Judicial Immunity Fails Here

1. **Non-Judicial Acts**: Database searches, public disclosures, and targeting non-parties are not judicial functions
2. **No Jurisdiction**: Miller was not a party to any case before the court
3. **Clearly Established Rights**: Under *Taylor v. Riojas* and *McCoy v. Alamu*, some violations are so obvious immunity doesn't apply
4. **Supreme Court Precedent**: *Tanzin v. Tanvir* establishes courts cannot create policy-based immunities

#### The Core Question

**Can a judge use their position to target, defame, and violate the constitutional rights of a private citizen who is not even a party to proceedings before them—and claim absolute immunity?**

This repository contains all associated legal documents from both cases.

## Legal Significance

### Precedential Questions

This case presents several questions of first impression and constitutional significance:

1. **Judicial Immunity Boundaries**: Can judges claim immunity for targeting non-parties?
2. **Digital Privacy Rights**: What protections exist against judicial access to sealed records?
3. **Non-Party Standing**: Can individuals sue for violations when they're not parties to the underlying case?
4. **Prosecutorial Accountability**: Can prosecutors be held liable for suppressing exculpatory evidence?

### Relevant Supreme Court Precedent

- **Taylor v. Riojas** (2020): Some constitutional violations are so obvious that immunity doesn't apply
- **McCoy v. Alamu** (2020): "Every reasonable official" would know certain conduct is unlawful
- **Tanzin v. Tanvir** (2020): Courts cannot create policy-based immunities; that's Congress's job
- **Gibson v. Goldston**: Judicial immunity lost when acting in complete absence of jurisdiction
- **Mireles v. Waco**: Acts outside judicial capacity not protected
- **Forrester v. White**: Administrative acts distinguished from judicial functions
